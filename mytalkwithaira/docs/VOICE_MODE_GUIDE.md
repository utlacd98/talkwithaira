## Tips for Best Results

### 🎯 Speaking Tips

- **Pause between thoughts** - helps with accurate transcription
- **Review before sending** - you can edit the transcribed text if needed

### 🔊 Listening Tips

### ⚡ Performance Tips
- **Use Chrome or Edge** - best browser support for voice features
- **Grant microphone permission** - required for speech-to-text
- **Check your connection** - voice processing is local, but responses need internet
- **One at a time** - wait for Aira to finish speaking before recording again
