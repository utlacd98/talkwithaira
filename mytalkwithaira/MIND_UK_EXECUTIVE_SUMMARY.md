## 👤 Who I Am

**Andrew Barrett** - Founder & Creator of Aira

I'm a passionate advocate for accessible mental health support, driven by the belief that **no one should ever feel alone or unheard.** I've created Aira to bridge the gap between those who need mental health support and the limited resources available.

## 🚨 The Problem

### The UK Mental Health Crisis:

- **1 in 4 people** experience mental health problems each year
- **1.6 million people** waiting for NHS mental health treatment
- **18-24 weeks** average wait time for talking therapies
- **75% of people** with mental health problems receive **no support**
- **Only 1 in 8 adults** with mental health problems are in treatment

### The Gap:

**People need support NOW, not in 6 months.**

When anxiety strikes at 2 AM, when panic attacks happen on weekends, when intrusive thoughts become overwhelming—traditional services aren't available.

**This is where Aira comes in.**
