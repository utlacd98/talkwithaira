- "Coming Soon" placeholders for future games
- Responsive design (mobile & desktop)
- Dark/Light theme support

### 2. Noughts & Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe)
- **Player**: O (human)

### 3. Aira Dialogue System
Located in `/lib/airaReactions.ts`:

```typescript
export const AiraTalk = {
  start: [...],      // Game start messages
  move: [...],       // Player move reactions
  win: [...],        // Player win messages
  lose: [...],       // Aira win messages
  draw: [...],       // Draw game messages
  gameOver: [...]    // Game over prompts
}
```

**Features**:

- Context-aware reactions (e.g., different messages after many moves)
- Easy to extend with new messages

## 🕹️ Game Mechanics

### Tic-Tac-Toe AI

The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** with depth-based scoring:

```
Scoring:
- AI Win (X): 10 - depth (prefers faster wins)
- Human Win (O): depth - 10 (prefers to avoid losses)
- Draw: 0
```

This ensures:
- ✅ AI plays optimally
- ✅ AI prefers quick wins
- ✅ AI tries to prevent losses
- ✅ Challenging but fair gameplay

### Game Flow

1. **Start**: Player clicks "Start Game"
2. **Player Turn**: User clicks a square to place "O"
3. **AI Turn**: After 800ms delay, AI calculates best move and places "X"
4. **Win/Draw**: Game ends when someone wins or board is full
5. **Replay**: Player can click "Play Again" to restart

## 🎨 Design & Styling

### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: Green (#3acf85) - Player moves
- **Secondary**: Purple (#9d4edd) - AI moves
- **Accent**: Cyan (#00e5b8) - Highlights

### Components Used
- Shadcn UI Button, Card components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Glass morphism effects
- Smooth transitions and animations

### Responsive Design
- Mobile: Single column layout
- Tablet: 2-column grid
- Desktop: 3-column grid for games hub

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Users

   - From Dashboard: Click "Play with Aira" button
   - Direct URL: `/games`

2. **Play Tic-Tac-Toe**:
   - Click on "Noughts & Crosses" card

### For Developers

#### Adding New Messages to Aira

Edit `/lib/airaReactions.ts`:

```typescript
export const AiraTalk = {
  start: [
    "Your new message here! 😊",
    // ... existing messages
  ],
  // ... other categories
}
```

#### Creating a New Game

1. Create component in `/components/games/NewGame.tsx`
2. Add game card to `/app/games/page.tsx`
3. Update game type in `GameType` union
4. Add game logic and styling

Example structure:

```typescript
export function NewGame() {
  const [gameState, setGameState] = useState(...)
  const [airaMessage, setAiraMessage] = useState(getRandomReaction("start"))
  
  // Game logic here
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Aira message */}
      {/* Game board/interface */}
      {/* Stats and controls */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## 📊 Game Stats

Currently tracked locally in component state:
- Wins
- Losses
- Draws

### Future Enhancement: Redis Storage

To persist stats across sessions:

```typescript
// Save stats to Redis
await fetch(`/api/games/stats`, {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userId: user.id,
    game: "tictactoe",
    stats: { wins, losses, draws }
  })
})
```
